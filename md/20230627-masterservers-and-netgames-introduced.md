Liquid Underground's website now features a dedicated [Master Servers]
page! No more sifting through the `#featured` channel on Discord and no more
need to join our Discord to find out about what LiquidMS nodes are available to use.
As of now, this page is manually maintained by me and requires either a
pull request or a plain old verbal request towards me for your new nodes to
be listed, but I still hope that this archive will be useful to everyone
interested in utilizing LiquidMS, especially our players.

Furthermore, we've also launched a [Netgames] page to let netgame hosts
officially advertise their affiliation with Liquid Underground and be
discovered both by and through our community. Once again, simply file a
pull request or ask for your netgame to be added to the list, featuring all
information necessary for the table on the site.

Thank you for reading
