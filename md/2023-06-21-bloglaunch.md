Hello,

As this website seemed rather dormant for such a public outlet of Liquid
Underground, I've decided to put a blog system into here. In short, it's a
Makefile-based static site generator based on Pandoc, but for further
details, I suggest looking at the [website repository]'s `README.md`.

In order to conveniently relay our news towards [LiquidLauncher], it also
features an RSS feed at <https://liquidunderground.github.io/feed.rss>
which will soon be integrated as the launcher's default news feed.

Naturally, in typical LqU manner, I've also added instructions on how to
submit your own articles on here on our [website repository]. That way,
this blog can serve as a central news outlet for all the Liquid Underground
community wants to share.

Thanks  
- PixL
