At last, [LiquidLauncher] finally reached it's first full version, `v1.0`.
This update now features both new extension as well as restored old ones,
such as the ability to download mods from within the launcher. Here's a
quick rundown of the changes

### Added functionality

- Support for Skybase and Gamebanana added
- Support for custom Skins and Colors added
- SRB2 Flatpak support
- Added a ridiculous amount of game config options
  - Dedicated Battlemod support
- Implemented MS-agnostic room queries
- Fixed mod downloading
- Added developer options
- Added snitch button
- Implemented multi-row operations for netgame/MS tables

### Quality-of-Life

- Icons added to game view menu and mod list to distinguish between
  modsources
- Changed Master Server API setting to comboboxes
- Migrated config formats to TOML
- Asynchronization of most queries
- Games are now launched as separate processes
- Lots of error text and microprint to get started

Aside from tons of new features and other quality-of-life improvements,
LiquidLauncher now also integrates neatly into our emerging infrastructure
such as our newsfeed and our most popular LiquidMS nodes such that you can
now conveniently access the Underground right from within LiquidLauncher.
