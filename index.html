<h1>Who we are</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Liquid Underground. We are a Sonic Robo Blast 2 subcommunity that seeks to
develop software and integrate players into an interconnected,
easy-to-access network based on distributed technology, collaborative
development, open sharing, respect for independence and a strict focus on solving
problems. We adhere to nine principles, which we refer to as <em>The Zen of
Liquid:</em> </p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal is out of the question</li>
<li>Reference is better than ownership</li>
<li>Useful is better than righteous</li>
<li>Expression is better than moderation</li>
<li>Public is better than polished</li>
<li>The project over the community</li>
<li>Distributed is better than organised</li>
<li>Collaboration is better than leadership</li>
<li>Independence is better than compliance</li>
</ol>
<p>You can reach us by <a href="https://discord.gg/HVTzVfAWG6/">joining our Discord community.</a></p>
