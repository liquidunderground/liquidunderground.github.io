LiquidLauncher
--------------

[LiquidLauncher](https://github.com/liquidunderground/liquidlauncher/)
is a feature-rich launcher for Sonic Robo Blast 2 based on
[LauncherBlast2-reBoot by HitCoder9768](https://github.com/HitCoder9768/LauncherBlast2-reBoot).
It's built to provide wide access to SRB2, it's technology and it's
community right to your fingertips:

- Quickly configure various game settings using game profiles
- Create launch scripts to quickly run and share premade game setups
  independent of any launcher
- Create mod lists to easily include a multitude of mods upon game startup
- Explore and download mods from all across the SRB2 community, right from
  within your launcher
- Directly browse and join netgames from any SRB2, SRB2 Kart and/or
  LiquidMS Master Server
- Fetch news from all across the SRB2 and wider Sonic communities using our
  integrated news reader.
- Easily share and download configurations, profiles and launch scripts
  using our [config repository]("https://github.com/liquidunderground/configs-public/")

LiquidMS
--------

[LiquidMS](https://github.com/zibonbadi/liquidms/) is a clean room Master
Server implementation compatible with Sonic Robo Blast 2.  Here are some of
it's features:


- Rock-solid hosting based on modern web server technology
- Host any kind of network setup imaginable using our thoroughly modular, flexible, distributed and resilient architecture
- Mirror any API-compliant master server, both internally as well as externally from your node
- Share netgames between multiple LiquidMS nodes, using our custom *Snitch API*
- Host a highly polished, blazing fast or even your very own web-based server browser right on your LiquidMS node.
- (Future): Host Master servers for Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart and Sonic Robo Blast 2 Legacy using our built-in API support


Liquid Mod Jam
--------------

We are currently seeking modders to participate in our very own modding
jam, but we're currently understaffed in modders to host the event. Public
is better than polished, so we're still open for it, in case you're interested.
