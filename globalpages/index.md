Welcome to Liquid Underground.  We are a Sonic Robo Blast 2 subcommunity
that seeks to develop software and integrate players into an
interconnected, easy-to-access network based on distributed technology,
collaborative development, open sharing, respect for independence and a
strict focus on solving problems. We adhere to nine principles, which we
refer to as *The Zen of Liquid:* 

1. Illegal is out of the question
2. Reference is better than ownership
3. Useful is better than righteous
4. Expression is better than moderation
5. Public is better than polished
6. The project over the community
7. Distributed is better than organised
8. Collaboration is better than leadership
9. Independence is better than compliance
